# Project-Maximizing_driver_revenue

Problem Statement
Our objective is to determine whether payment methods have a significant effect on fare amounts. Specifically, we focus on the relationship between payment type and fare amount, aiming to derive actionable insights that maximize revenue for taxi drivers.

Dataset
Taken from: https://data.world/vizwiz/nyc-taxi-jan-2020/workspace/file?filename=yellow_tripdata_2020-01.csv
A real world dataset
Source: The dataset includes a variety of data points relevant to taxi trip transactions, including payment methods, fare amount, and additional trip details.

Project Workflow
Data Exploration (EDA): Conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis to understand data distribution, detect outliers, and identify patterns.
Visualization: Used data visualization techniques to illustrate relationships between payment types, fare amounts, and other influencing factors.
Hypothesis Testing: Performed hypothesis testing to analyze the relationship between payment type and revenue potential, identifying any statistically significant trends.
Conclusions and Recommendations: Based on the data insights, we developed strategies to enhance revenue potential for taxi drivers by encouraging specific payment types.

Encourage Credit Card Payments:

Analysis showed that customers paying with credit cards generally led to higher revenue for drivers.
Encourage customers to use credit cards by highlighting the convenience and potential benefits of this method.
Implement Incentives for Credit Card Transactions:

Offer discounts or incentives for credit card payments, motivating customers to prefer this payment option over others.
This approach helps capture increased revenue while improving customer experience.
Enhance Credit Card Payment Experience:

Provide secure, seamless credit card payment options to increase customer confidence and encourage wider adoption.
Improving convenience and security can lead to increased revenue potential from card transactions.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python: For data processing, EDA, and visualization.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib : Visualization tools to plot relationships and insights.
Hypothesis Testing: Statistical tests to validate findings.
